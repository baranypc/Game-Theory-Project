## Dataset: Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix

This dataset contains a 40x40 payoff matrix generated via Python simulations. 
Each cell represents the average score of a matchup between two game theory strategies.

- **Rows/Columns:** 40 different strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Pavlov, Defector).
- **Total Samples:** 1600 matchup results.
- **Goal:** To analyze the statistical performance differences between cooperative and competitive algorithms.
